# Bank Register

## Description

Bank Register is a Rails app that will display a list of transactions you've made, as well as display a running total of money you have in your account.

## How to use
Once the server is running, set your browser to http://localhost:3000/bank_registers. You will see a table of transaction names and totals, and a total balance at the bottom. Be careful not to go over your limit!
